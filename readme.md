# ECG Image Classification

## Overview

This repository provides a machine learning model for classifying ECG (Electrocardiogram) images. Additionally, it includes a web application that allows users to upload ECG images, and the model will make predictions to identify potential heart conditions.

## Introduction

- An Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a valuable diagnostic tool used to assess the electrical activity of the heart. 
- This project combines machine learning with a user-friendly web interface to classify ECG images and provide potential diagnoses based on the captured data.
